      <description>This blog serves as a personal time capsule of various topics which have crossed my path and I was unable to find solutions for online, or the solutions found online weren&amp;rsquo;t clear enough for my liking.
At the very least, I hope you find information that helps you on your journey across the digital landscape.
Feel free to get in touch via Twitter or one of my links.
Cheers,
